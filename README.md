## Grid Landing Page #2

### A rollercoaster

Today was a tough one. There is something about being under pressure to be productive. Today I ended up almost deleting all my github repositories from my pc and then almost committing those deletions to the web app.

### Making a friend

In the process of undertaking this mini project. I met a really fantastic and incredibly knowledgable man called Terry. You can find him on Twitter at @AgentZeroNine. He was kind enough to teach me a few things and recommended a couple of articles.

### Skill set demonstrated
I tried to utilise various skills that are relatively new to me and so aren't fully ingrained.

- I used CSS to create a 12 by 12 grid layout
- I used a downloaded font
- I used the font:; property 
- I began revising how to make forms

### Areas to improve

- Stronger knowledge of form element and related elements, particularly important to understand how they display.
- Fundamental CSS grid practise and comprehension
- Methods to ensure consistency of grid implementation across browsers.
